# Flashcards

In this project, I use Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. 

Users are able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users are also able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

This project is part of Codecademy's project assignment for the Full Stack developer course.
